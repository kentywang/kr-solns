/*
01100101 (0x65)
rotate right 3 times:
10101100 (0xAC)

We just need these:
?...?000
0...0???

Getting the first is easy; just right shift.
The second is harder without knowing the size of the bitfield, but if we left-shift 0...0111 until its value changes unexpectedly, we can know the how 
many shifts to do to move ??? to the left.
Finally, OR the two.
